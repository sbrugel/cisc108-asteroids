# cisc108-asteroids
This was my final project for CISC108 (Intro to Computer Science I) at the University of Delaware.

This is a recreation of the Atari game *Asteroids*, made in Python using the Designer.py library. While not 100% a copy of it, the key features are included:
- The player plays as a spaceship, whose rotation and movement can be controlled using the arrow and WASD keys
- The spaceship wraps around the screen if it hits an edge
- Asteroids of varying sizes periodically spawn
- The player can shoot at asteroids; if a larger one is it, it splits into two smaller asteroids
- Bonus items spawn and can earn the player points if their ship runs into them
- The player ship is killed if it hits an asteroid directly
